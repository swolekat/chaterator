# chaterator
Website for seeing multiple chats at one time.

Currently supported platforms:
* Twitch
* Youtube
* Kick
* Tiktok (kinda... You need to use tikfinity and paste the chat overlay like https://tikfinity.zerody.one/widget/activity-feed?cid=2120852&did=1 for example)

# Known Issues
I would highly recommend you use this site on chrome since that's what youtube probably tests with. 

* If you aren't logged into yt then it won't show the chat
* If you are logged in with multiple yt accounts it won't show the chat.
* I can't get tiktok to work since they don't support embedding of any stream related stuff.
